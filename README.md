In his famous article of 2007, Howard Wainer writes about very dangerous equations:

"Some equations  are  dangerous  if you  know them, and others are dangerous if you do not. The first category may  pose  danger  because the secrets  within its bounds open  doors  behind which lies terrible peril. The obvious winner in this is Einstein’s iconic equation $E = MC^2$, for it  provides  a  measure of  the  enormous energy hidden  within  ordinary  matter. \[...\] Instead I am interested in equations that unleash their danger not when we know about them, but rather when we do not. Kept close at hand, these equations allow us to understand things clearly, but their absence leaves us dangerously ignorant."

The equation he talks about is Moivre’s equation:

$
SE = \dfrac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} 
$
